Object Oriented Programmming
    All along, we have been doing structured programming. We 
have been solving problems step by step.
    OOP is a concept of programming that advocates to create 
software basing on real world objects.
For example, Windows Operating System are named after real 
world objects like windows of houses. Or Apple machines like 
real apple fruits.
    All objects are coming from a class. A class is a blueprint 
of an object. And an object is an instance of a class. A blueprint 
is a master copy of an object.(i.e. the original thing that we 
duplicate)

Concepts in OOP
1. Abstraction.
This is the level of representation. e.g. Animal(). It is what 
we use to identify classes. Something that's not definitive enough.

2. Inheritance.
This is where an object can take on things from different classes.
Some things of an object can be different from that of the 
class. (An object has its own different things.)

3. Polymorphism.
Here an object can take on different forms/classes. e.g. a 
daughter in a class of a father.

4. Encapsulation.
The ability to restrict some of the content from being accessed.

5. Overloading and overriding.
