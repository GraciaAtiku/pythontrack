Object Oriented Programmming
    All along, we have been doing structured programming. We 
have been solving problems step by step.
    OOP is a concept of programming that advocates to create 
software basing on real world objects.
For example, Windows Operating System are named after real 
world objects like windows of houses. Or Apple machines like 
real apple fruits.
    All objects are coming from a class. A class is a blueprint 
of an object. And an object is an instance of a class. A blueprint 
is a master copy of an object.(i.e. the original thing that we 
duplicate)
