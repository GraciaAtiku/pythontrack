# Syntax for variable naming in python.
# 1) The name of a variable should not start with a numeral or a number.(like 1space, 2space)
# 2) The name should not start with any symbol.(#,!,%)
# 3) If you have a compound name, one with more than one word, you should not leave spaces between the 
#    words. A variable name is the same as a folder name. Instead, use underscores (_) or use carmel 
#    notion/notation/case. (e.g. pay_as_you_earn or payAsYouEarn.)
# 4) Use relatable variable names. (e.g., name, salary, income, as opposed to x,y,z.)
# 5) It is recommended to start a variable name with small letters.
# 6) In python, any variable name should have a value. When we are declaring a variable, we should
#    initialize it.(salary = 1000)
# 7) Try to use shorter variable names. (e.g. sal for salary, net for net_pay)
# 8) Don't use special key words as variable names.(like 'print')



# Declaring variables.
name = 'Gracia Atiku'
age = '22'
gender = 'female'
num1 = '20'
num2 = 20
print ('Dear '+ name +', welcome to python world!')
print (num2)
